title: Insert Image from Cloudinary
---
Below is an image sourced from Cloudinary.



You can't see it, but when I click *Add component > Image*, Netlify CMS will open my Cloudinary library, and I can choose the image that I want to insert into this post.



This is now the original image that I downloaded from Unsplash and then uploaded to Cloudinary as it was. I selected the image in the editor, than clicked **Edit** button to scale it to 1600px wide.
